# Overview

React frontend intern task for Opera by Mateusz Boboryko.

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Under the hood, Next.js abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allowed me to focus on building my application instead of spending time with configuration.

Main frontend code is located in /src/app/(slider)

Backend part in the form of a simple API endpoint is located in /src/app/api/slides

## How to run

Single command to install node packages and run the application:

```
npm run allWithInstall
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Individual commands

To install node packages:

```
npm install
```

To build and run the app:

```
npm run app
```

To run just the development server with hot-reload:

```
npm run dev
```
